/**
 * The backlog gate — the checks that keep a "ready" queue an answer rather
 * than a dump.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-17 in the repository that bought these rules: 933 issues
 * open, 773 of them reported ready to work, spread over 665 independent roots;
 * 82 of the 83 in progress had not been touched in over two days; 399 open
 * items had not been touched in thirty. Nothing in that state can answer "what
 * do I work on next", so filing became cheaper than searching, and every issue
 * filed made the next search worse. Each check below is one rule that grooming
 * had to invent on the spot, and each carries the case that bought it, because
 * a rule whose reason is invisible is a rule somebody deletes.
 *
 * IT KNOWS NO TRACKER AND NO PROJECT. Input is the normalized backlog described
 * in model.md, on stdin or as a path, and a config naming the project's
 * vocabulary. Both the adapter that produces the first and the second itself
 * live in the project, never beside this file: a rule that travels with a
 * project's words has stopped being a rule and become that project's script.
 *
 * HOW HARD IT BINDS IS THE PROJECT'S CHOICE, one of three, and never silence:
 *
 *   block      any error-severity violation fails.
 *   block-new  only a violation ABSENT FROM THE BASELINE fails; the rest is
 *              debt, printed every time. Both sides are aged against the same
 *              clock, so an issue that merely grew a day older overnight is
 *              not something this commit did.
 *   report     nothing fails. The report is still printed: a gate may be
 *              switched off, its report may not, or in a month there is a red
 *              gate nobody remembers.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE:
 *
 *   - AGE IS A LIE AFTER A BULK EDIT, and this is the blind spot that bit
 *     hardest. Deferring 802 issues rewrites 802 timestamps, and the next
 *     analysis reported epics untouched for 45 days as active today, because
 *     they were — by a status change nobody would call work. So the report
 *     always names timestamp CLUSTERS and refuses to be quiet about them. It
 *     cannot tell a bulk edit from a busy hour; it can only say which minutes
 *     to distrust, and let the adapter be re-run against an earlier revision.
 *   - IT CANNOT SEE A MISSING FEATURE. Every check is a statement about issues
 *     that exist. An epic nobody filed, a stage with no issue, a criterion
 *     that holds but is unwritten: all invisible.
 *   - `epic-without-criterion` IS A TEXT SEARCH for a heading or a phrase. An
 *     epic stating its criterion in prose is reported; an empty heading is
 *     also reported. A few words are a signal, not a proof of a good criterion.
 *   - IT CANNOT FIND A DUPLICATE. That check belongs to whoever is about to
 *     file, because duplicates are rarely near-copies: a split-panes epic was
 *     filed twice because the searches were "split", "pane" and
 *     "panes" while the existing issue was titled "Drag one tab onto another
 *     and watch both at once".
 *   - `stale-edge` MEASURES THE BLOCKER, NOT THE EDGE. Few trackers date an
 *     edge, so the model carries none, and a brand-new dependency on an old
 *     issue reads the same as an old one. It is a warning for that reason.
 *   - A RENAMED ID IS A NEW ISSUE. `block-new` matches a violation by check,
 *     issue id and the other party to it. A tracker that renumbers turns old
 *     debt into new errors once, and nothing here can know better.
 *   - IT JUDGES NO SCOPE. Whether the current milestone is the right one, and
 *     whether a criterion is a good criterion, belong to the owner.
