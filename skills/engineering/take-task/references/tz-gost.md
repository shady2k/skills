# A ТЗ or ПМИ by ГОСТ from the living documents

Part of the set's protocol, whose core is `protocol.md`: the same in every
project, and it wins over a project's restatement.
When a customer, a tender or a state contract requires a technical specification
(ТЗ) or an acceptance test programme (ПМИ) by Russian standards, it is drafted
from the living documents, never kept beside them.

**An export profile, not a conforming document by itself.** The vision,
charters, capability specs, architecture and decision records stay the truth;
the draft is generated from them for the revision it names, in the language the
customer requires, and regenerated rather than edited when they change. What
they do not hold is asked for at export time and recorded with the draft, never
invented: the customer and the developer, the contract and its basis, planned
dates and financing, the procedure for presenting and approving results, the
parties who sign. Say which fields came from where and which are still missing.

**Approval is the contract's, not the owner's.** The owner's approval of a
change record says what the product will do; it is not the formal approval the
standard and the contract require. A ТЗ the customer approves becomes a
contract document: a later change to the requirements it covers is still a
change record here, and the amendment to the ТЗ (дополнение) is approved the
same way as the original, by the parties the contract names. Record the
evidence of that approval with the draft; do not treat the document gate's
approval as it.

**Which standard.** ГОСТ 34.602-2020 («Техническое задание на создание
автоматизированной системы») for a system that automates an organisation's
activity, which covers most commissioned software; ГОСТ 19.201-78 (ЕСПД) for a
single program. Ask which one the contract names; do not choose for the
customer.

**Mapping for ГОСТ 34.602-2020.** Its ten sections, by their names in the
standard; a mandatory section with nothing to require records that there are no
requirements, and never disappears.

| ТЗ section | Drafted from |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Общие сведения | asked at export: names, contract, basis, dates, financing, procedure for results |
| 2. Цели и назначение создания автоматизированной системы | vision: problem, outcome, success signal |
| 3. Характеристика объекта автоматизации | vision: audience, key journeys, constraints; glossary |
| 4. Требования к автоматизированной системе | as its subsections below |
| 4.1 Требования к структуре автоматизированной системы в целом | architecture: building blocks, deployment |
| 4.2 Требования к функциям (задачам), выполняемым автоматизированной системой | capability specs: requirements and scenarios, by capability |
| 4.3 Требования к видам обеспечения | architecture (software, hardware, information: data model and stores); glossary (linguistic) |
| 4.4 Общие технические требования к автоматизированной системе | capability specs' quality requirements, gathered by category; categories the standard lists and the specs do not cover are asked, not left out |
| 5. Состав и содержание работ по созданию автоматизированной системы | roadmap and milestone charters; dates asked at export |
| 6. Порядок разработки автоматизированной системы | the project's process: tracked work, reviews, checks |
| 7. Порядок контроля и приёмки автоматизированной системы | acceptance scenarios and checks, and the ПМИ below |
| 8. Требования к составу и содержанию работ по подготовке объекта автоматизации к вводу автоматизированной системы в действие | vision constraints; rollout sections of change designs; asked where absent |
| 9. Требования к документированию | the document set the project keeps and what the contract requires |
| 10. Источники разработки | vision, research explorations, decision records |

Check the section numbering and names against the standard's text before
issuing a draft; subsection numbering inside section 4 varies with the system.

**The ПМИ** (content by ГОСТ Р 59795-2021, test kinds by ГОСТ Р 59792-2021) is
a separate export. The acceptance scenarios supply its checks, what is checked
and how; its other sections — the object and purpose of the tests, the general
provisions, the scope, the conditions and procedure, the material and
metrological support, the reporting, the methods — come from the architecture,
the test environment, who is responsible, and the records of test runs, and are
asked for where those do not hold them.

**What is not taken over.** Staged design packages (эскизный and технический
проект) are produced only when the contract names them, drafted from the
architecture and decision records. Formatting to the standard's layout,
document codes and signature sheets are the export's job at the end, not a
shape the living documents take.
